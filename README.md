Used algorithm : Mini-max

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.

## Try the Project - WebApp

### 1. Install Docker

To run this project, the first step is to install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) on your machine. Docker simplifies deployment by providing an isolated environment for your application.

### 2. Install Make (Optional)

This project includes a Makefile, which allows you to execute Docker commands more easily, without having to type them manually. While using `make` is optional, it is highly recommended to simplify operations. You can install `make` by following [this link](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/#download) or by searching for installation instructions specific to your system.

### 3. Run the WebApp

#### With Make

Run this command in your terminal:

```bash
make
```
This will display:

Next, run this to start the web application:

```bash
make run
```
#### Without Make

If you prefer not to use `make`, you can start the web application by running the following command:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml build
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
```
